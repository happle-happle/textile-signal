- Luca Budofsky took an independent study with Harrison Apple during Fall 2024 while enrolled at the CMU School of Art.
- Luca learned weaving fundamentals including warp calculation, warp winding, loom dressing, and weaving on a four-harness table loom.
  - They chose to thread an undulating twill using 8/2 cotton rug warp set at 15 epi. They experimented with found yarns (plastic, metal, so on) and coloring the warp.
- For their final project of this independent study they wound a warp to dye after dressing the loom.
  - There were some struggles including not having a raddle to work with. Unraddled winding on meant that the tension of the warp became unevent when advancing and winding back on for the dyeing process.
